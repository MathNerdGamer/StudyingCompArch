# Digital Design & Computer Architecture Repository

Learning [Digital Design](https://www.edx.org/learn/design/harvey-mudd-college-digital-design) & [Computer Architecture](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-architecture/harvey-mudd-college-computer-architecture) using the edX courses from HarveyMuddX. This repository will hold my notes from the course, as well as any source code I write independently to study the material.
